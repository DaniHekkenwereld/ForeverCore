# ForeverCore

A small, experimental Warrior-focused UI addon for **World of Warcraft: Forever (beta)**. Built for a Protection/Fury Warrior and intended to keep common raid preparation checks in one place.

> **Beta prototype:** The addon has not yet been validated in the live WoW Forever beta client. API behavior, TOC version and macro conditions may change. No combat automation is provided.

## Included in v0.1.0-beta

- Attempt to enable default friendly nameplates automatically in raid instances (`/fc plates auto`). This depends on Blizzard restrictions and client CVar support.
- Movable pre-pull status panel.
- Out-of-combat checks for a flask buff, food buff and Battle Shout, plus a shield/stance check for the tank profile.
- Manually switch between tank and Fury profiles.
- Generate 15 character-specific Warrior macros without overwriting existing ones. Combo macros are **manual**, with modifier keys for each cooldown.

## Installation

1. Exit WoW.
2. Copy the **contents of this repository** into your addon directory under a folder named `ForeverCore`, such as:

   ```text
   World of Warcraft\_classic_beta_\Interface\AddOns\ForeverCore\
     ForeverCore_Camelot.toc
     Core.lua
   ```

   The client installation directory can differ. The `.toc` file must sit directly in `AddOns\ForeverCore\`.
3. Launch WoW Forever, enable **ForeverCore** on the AddOns screen and run `/fc help`.

## Commands

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `/fc help` | Show available commands |
| `/fc check` | Run the pre-pull check again (out of combat) |
| `/fc move` | Drag the status panel (out of combat) |
| `/fc show on` or `/fc show off` | Show/hide the panel outside raid instances |
| `/fc plates auto` | Try to show friendly nameplates in raid instances only |
| `/fc plates on` or `/fc plates off` | Try to force friendly nameplates on or off |
| `/fc mode tank` or `/fc mode fury` | Set the Warrior profile manually |
| `/fc flask on/off` | Toggle flask check |
| `/fc food on/off` | Toggle food check |
| `/fc shout on/off` | Toggle Battle Shout check |
| `/fc macros` | Create the 15 character-specific Warrior macros |

To use new macros, open `/macro` and drag them to your action bars.

### Combo macro behavior

- `FC-ReckRet`: normal press = Recklessness; Shift = Retaliation.
- `FC-ReckWall`: normal press = Recklessness; Shift = Shield Wall.
- `FC-All3`: normal = Recklessness; Shift = Retaliation; Ctrl = Shield Wall.

**Important:** Stance changes may require a second button press. Shield Wall requires a shield. These macros must be tested against the current Forever beta class design; none casts multiple combat cooldowns automatically.

## Known limitations

- Addons cannot reliably compare protected/secret boss target data in some combat contexts. A reliable **boss targets me** alert has **not** been implemented in v0.1. Use Blizzard's target-of-target UI where supported.
- Friendly raid nameplates are restricted by Blizzard. A CVar request can be rejected or ignored, and the addon does not customize Blizzard friendly nameplates.
- Consumables are checked outside combat only; flask/food identification currently relies on English/Dutch buff-name matching. Custom Forever buffs may need explicit matching.
- SavedVariables persistence and client interface version need confirmation in the actual beta.
- A full cooldown HUD, threat UI, encounter warnings and configurable options panel are not included yet.

## Roadmap

1. In-game API smoke test and bug fixes.
2. Better pre-pull aura detection, including Forever-specific buffs.
3. Protection/Fury HUD for cooldowns, rage and defensive readiness, subject to beta API limits.
4. Movable configuration UI and modules.
5. Encounter-specific warnings and safer boss target signals when supported by the addon API.
